'''
This program lists all available interfaces present in localhost and uses Scapy to identify all online
machines accessible through each of the localhostâ€™s non-virtual interfaces. To achieve this, this program creates
an ethernet frame which encapsulates an ARP packet. The ethernet frame has its destination address set to the
broadcast address while the ARP packet has the localhost's subnet address along with the CIDR notation. Finally,
Scapy creates a list of ARP packets which are broadcasted to every IP address in the subnet and prints the MAC and IP
addresses of the online machines which send a reply back to the localhost.
